If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app. Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company.

    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">  \n",
    "Yes, this is model performs acceptably. Its F<sub>1</sub> score was 0.7395 and it had an overall accuracy of 0.701. It correctly identified ~81% of the actual responders in the test set, which is 51% better than a random guess. It may be worthwhile to test the model with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.\n",

    "Unfortunately, random forest is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that `VendorID`, `predicted_fare`, `mean_duration`, and `mean_distance` are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that `VendorID` is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.  \n",

    "There are almost always additional features that can be engineered, but hopefully the most obvious ones were generated during the first round of modeling. In our case, we could try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. We could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of $5) / fare amount. For example, if the fare were $12, the value in this column would be 0.25, because $12 to the nearest higher multiple of $5 ($15) is $3, and $3 divided by $12 is 0.25. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of $5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of $5. We could also do the same thing for fares to the nearest $10.\n",
